I see testing as a great way to quickly get a grasp on a wide range of
frameworks and technologies at a very high level. I would like to use
it as the jumping-off point for a strong career at accenture.

My friend Jenny has a very high opinion of you as an employer. Your
well-tailored development resources, and supportive structures sound like
exactly what I need at this stage in my career. I particularly enjoy the
problem of identifying skills/resources within a team, and working out
how make the most of them, so I look forward to getting more training
in that area.

From my previous job and hobbies, I am used to working in small, widely
distributed teams, with a variety of different project management
processes. I anticipate this being useful when dealing with offshore
testing teams. I hope that this, combined with my strong belief in the
value of well-tested software will be an asset to the company.

I look forward to hearing from you, and hope to meet you at interview.

David.
